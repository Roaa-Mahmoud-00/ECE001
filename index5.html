            Some Other Applications:</h1>
                <ol type="1" style="font-size: 120%; font-family: 'Lucida Sans', 'Lucida Sans Regular', 'Lucida Grande', 'Lucida Sans Unicode', Geneva, Verdana, sans-serif;">

                        Wearables<br/> <p style="color: black;"> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Wearable technology is a hallmark of IoT applications and probably is one of the earliest industries to have deployed the IoT at its service. We happen to see Fit Bits, heart rate monitors and smartwatches everywhere these days.</p>

                    <li style="color: #191970;">
                        Smart Home Applications<br/> <p style="color: black;"> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; The best example I can think of here is Jarvis, the AI home automation employed by Mark Zuckerberg. There is also Allen Panâ€™s Home Automation System where functions in the house are actuated by use of a string of musical notes.</p>

                        Smart Cities<br/> <p style="color: black;"> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; By now I assume, most of you must have heard about the term Smart City. The hypothesis of the optimized traffic system is one of the many aspects that constitute a smart city.</p>

                      Health Care<br/> <p style="color: black;"> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; The resources that current medical research uses, lack critical real-world information. It mostly uses leftover data, controlled environments, and volunteers for medical examination. IoT opens ways to a sea of valuable data through analysis, real-time field data, and testing. 

                            The Internet of Things also improves the current devices in power, precision, and availability. IoT focuses on creating systems rather than just equipment.</p>

                        Agriculture<br/> <p style="color: black;"> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; A greenhouse farming technique enhances the yield of crops by controlling environmental parameters. However, manual handling results in production loss, energy loss, and labor cost, making the process less effective.

                            A greenhouse with embedded devices not only makes it easier to be monitored but also, enables us to control the climate inside it. Sensors measure different parameters according to the plant requirement and send it to the cloud. It, then, processes the data and applies a control action. </p>

                    <li style="color: #191970;">
                        Industrial Automation<br/> <p style="color: black;"> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; This is one of the fields where both faster developments, as well as the quality of products, are the critical factors for a higher Return on Investment. With IoT Applications, one could even re-engineer products and their packaging to deliver better performance in both cost and customer experience.</p>

                    Forward Looking</h1>
                    <P style="font-size: 140%; font-family: 'Lucida Sans', 'Lucida Sans Regular', 'Lucida Grande', 'Lucida Sans Unicode', Geneva, Verdana, sans-serif; font-size: 120%;">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Our planet has more connected devices than people. The IoT will transform the way businesses, governments, and humans interact with the rest of the connected world.
                        But as with any new technology, IoT issues do exist. Concerns include acceptance, cost, connectivity, security, and more. As many new players enter the field, standards still are being set. But even with these challenges, the end goals of IoT have so much promise.
                        As even newer technologies and connectivity strategies hit the market, IoT innovation will continue to evolve, furthering the transformation of unconnected objects into smart connected devices. This trend will impact industries of all kinds, as well as our personal lives.</P>
