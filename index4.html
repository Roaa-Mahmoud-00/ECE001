            Some Applications In Engineering:</h1>

                    RFID Technology<br/> <p style="color: black;"> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; RFID stands for Radio-free Identification. The system consists of little tags that are attached to items and can be tracked by a scanner. An example of using this in an engineering environment is a company that manufactures parts for on-site machinery can place a locker full of spare parts on site that uses RFID to track when items are removed and will trigger a delivery when stocks are getting low.</p>

                    Smart Dust<br/> <p style="color: black;" > &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  This IoT idea is in its early stages, and it may sound a bit ‘out there’. The concept is that nanotechnology is used to create tiny IoT sensors that are the size of a grain of sand. These can be used in industries such as oil exploration to track movements in rock formations or can be used to cover engineering machinery to detect and alert engineers to any faults or potential problems.</p>

                    Smart-planes<br/> <p style="color: black;"> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Until now IoT devices have been confined to the factory floor in the aerospace industry. However, there are plans to integrate IoT smart devices into the aeroplanes themselves, which means that technical or engineering problems can be flagged up to maintenance teams before faults actually develop.</p>

                    Energy Networks<br/> <p style="color: black;"> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; IoT technology is also being used by energy companies to improve their own operations. Oil and gas pipelines use smart-sensors to detect leaks quickly so they can be swiftly repaired.</p>

                    Remote Operation in Construction<br/> <p style="color: black;"> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Site machinery such as excavators and bulldozers are becoming increasingly fitted with IoT technology to allow remote operations. Sensors fitted to the machinery ensure safe movement. IoT also means that senior engineers or site foreman can track machinery and tools easily, giving them an overview of the entire worksite, especially useful for large-scale building projects. Another IoT device that can come in handy on a building site is Google Glass, which will allow engineers to access drawings and other important documents hands-free.</p>
