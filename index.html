		  <h1>&nbsp; &nbsp;WHAT IS IOT ?</h1>
		  	<p style="font-size: 120%;"> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; The Internet of Things (IoT) refers to a system of interrelated, internet-connected objects that are able to collect and transfer data over a wireless network without human intervention. It is making the fabric of the world around us more smarter and more responsive,
				 merging the digital and physical universes. </p>
				 <h2>&nbsp; &nbsp;ITS BEGINNING:</h2>
					 <p>The Internet of Things (IoT) has not been around for very long. However, there have been visions of machines communicating with one another since the early 1800s. Machines have been providing direct communications since the telegraph was developed in the 1830s and 1840s. Described as “wireless telegraphy,” the first radio voice transmission took place in 1900, providing another necessary component for developing the IOT.</p>
				<h4 style="font-size: 140%;">The Internet Of Things is every where around us. It is now portable, wearable, and implantable in many devices, for example:</h4>
